STILL IN PROGRESS v2

This program will monitor the supreme website, until it finds the item that the user is looking for.
As of now, the user will need to edit the code, instead of using an interface to find the specific item,
and to enter their information. Once the item is found, the program will add the item to the cart. 
Once the item was successfully added to the cart, the program will go to the cart, and then go to checkout.
Once it is on the checkout page, it will relay the users information to the supreme site, and attempt to successfully
purchase the item that the user was looking for.
